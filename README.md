# LTSMs-TimeSeries-Seasons
Makes Time-Based Predictions of future data by observing Trends and Seasonality
Based on inputs : Specified requirements of TOTALS of ALL Predictions for each month for EACH Model + Historical data 

ALL Runtimes : Sub 1 Minute

# WHY did I not use LTSMs for this case?
Despite their greater capabilities to analyse seasonalities, I realise they were the main issue being hugely consuming on time + requiring more data to forecast 12 months.
This project is to build a model that can handle both long and SHORT term datasets too (below 12 months worth)

ALTERNATIVE Models BESIDES Linear Regression -> to handle #Non-Negative Outputs!

A. Log Transformation

Pros:

Prevents negative forecasts naturally.

Preserves downward trends (since log values still go down, just not below zero).

Stabilizes variance if your sales vary a lot.

Cons:

May underpredict when raw values are very low.

Concerns with accuracy trade-off as 1. Log compresses larger values and spreads out smaller ones.

Requires all input y >= 0.

B. sklearn.linear_model.PoissonRegressor

-> predicts only non-negative outputs

Pros:

Non-negativity is guaranteed mathematically.

More suitable for count data like sales.

Can still learn decreasing trends (e.g., 20 â†’ 15 â†’ 10).

Cons:

Assumes target is Poisson-distributed â€” may need to check if that's a good fit.

More sensitive to outliers than linear regression.

12linear2another.py

SAME as 12linear2.py EXCEPT

Non-Negativity Logic has been shifted from within the model to outside of the model -> During Rescaling Step

Replacing Clipping Negative OUTPUTS

future_vals = np.clip(reg.predict(X_future), 0, None)

With Ignoring Negative FORECASTS to 0

preds_for_model = np.maximum(preds_for_model, 0)

Run Time : Less than a minute

What it does:

A linear regression model that maps out 1) Trends 2) Seasonality, with core focus on the trend.

Keeps only recent 24 months with filter, aggregating sales PER MONTH by (Model Name, Account Name), 

Linear Regression Modelling while ignoring extremes (beyond 1-99th percentile),

Rescaling is done at the Model Level, meaning ALL Account names for EACH Model Name

Firstly, we compute scaling factor through total model qty input/sum of predictions -> multiply all predictions by this 

Acquiring numbers with decimal points that add up total. 


Next, Use rounding logic, a) extract decimal points from integers b) round down all numbers get their total c) change some round down to round up starting with highest 

decimal point numbers until total in step b) matches input model total

Rounding to ensure 

1) Forecasted values are WHOLE NUMBERS, through clipping negative numbers to 0

2) Add up to totals given in 

future_total_sell_outs_pivoted.xlsx input requisites given, export into a fresh Excel File (forecast_output_trend_seasonality)

with rounded values in cells, coloured red = rounded UP, coloured green = rounded DOWN


Input Files: 

future_total_sell_outs_pivoted.xlsx (Columns B onwards:year_month ~ eg. 06-2025, Column A: Model Name, Values = monthly requirement EXACT totals to be met when splitting 

Model Name to all Account Name later!),

# ðŸ“Œ Forecasting Logic Notes

"""
This code performs multivariate time series forecasting using a simple linear regression model per (Model Name, Account Name) pair.
It incorporates both trend and seasonality, with a post-processing step to ensure total volumes match provided forecasts.
"""

# âœ… 1. Data Preparation
- Filters sales data for "LCD TV" category and valid sell-out values.
- Converts dates to year-month periods.
- Keeps only the most recent 24 months.
- Encodes model and account names as integers.

# âœ… 2. Time Series Pivot
- Aggregates monthly sales by (Model, Account).
- Reshapes into a pivot table with time as rows and each (Model, Account) as a column.

# âœ… 3. Linear Regression Model with Seasonality
- For each (Model, Account) pair:
  - Uses month index (0â€“23) as the trend feature.
  - Adds monthly dummy variables (Januaryâ€“December) as seasonality indicators.
  - Removes outliers outside the 1stâ€“99th percentile.
  - Trains a linear regression model on cleaned data.

# âœ… 4. Forecasting
- Predicts 12 future months by extending the trend and using correct month dummies.
- Clips negative values to zero.

# âœ… 5. Forecast Assembly
- Combines forecasts from all (Model, Account) pairs into a matrix.

# âœ… 6. Rescaling to Match Total Volumes
- Forecasts are rescaled to match known future model-level totals from external Excel.
- Rounds down forecasted values.
- Distributes any rounding remainder based on highest residuals.
- Marks adjustments as 'up' or 'down' for Excel highlighting.

# âœ… 7. Export to Excel
- Forecast is pivoted to (Model, Account) rows and months as columns.
- Excel cells are colored red if rounded up, green if rounded down.
- Final file: `forecast_output_trend_seasonality.xlsx`

# âœ… Summary
- Combines linear trend + monthly seasonality.
- Ignores short-term fluctuations (no windowed inputs).
- Removes extreme outliers.
- Forecasts are always adjusted to match external totals.

LIMITATION: CANNOT learn downtrends, Biased towards Uptrends

Edit from 12linear.py

Different Non Negativity Logic

Differences

1) Using Lasso Machine Learning for L1 Regularisation of Coefficients, preventing overfitting

  Alpha value, default set to 0.001

  IF set to 0, it is a normal linear regression model!

3) No -ve Coeffs or Intercepts learnt in model. Minimum is 0.

12backteststime2bba.py

This way, your model can learn:

1. Seasonality (sin/cos of month)

2. Trend (year, time_index)

3. Month number for absolute time positioning

12backteststime2bb.py

Only using SEASONALITY to forecast forward 12 months of predictions
